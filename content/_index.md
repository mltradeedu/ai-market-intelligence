## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISK DISCLOSURES**

### **Multi-Asset Trading Risks**
Trading multiple assets simultaneously increases complexity and risk. Correlation between positions may increase during market stress, potentially amplifying losses.

### **Individual Stock Concentration Risk**
Large positions in individual names (AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA) carry company-specific risks including earnings disappointments, regulatory changes, and management decisions.

### **Volatility Warning**
Assets like TSLA exhibit high volatility which can result in rapid and substantial losses. Position sizing must account for individual asset characteristics.

### **Educational Purpose Only**
All analysis is for educational and informational purposes. This is not personalized investment advice. Consult qualified financial professionals for guidance specific to your situation.
